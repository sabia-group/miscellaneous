""" 02.10.2020 Karen Fidanyan
    This script calculates how interatomic distances change
    along the phonon modes provided in xyz_jmol format.

    They can be used in distances formulation of DMD,
    which was implemented in i-PI by Mariana and Karen in March-May 2020.

    One thing that can be improved if needed: one can move
    from absolute to relative distance changes Î”dist/dist,
    then it would work great for large systems also.

    It returns a file 'couplings-all.factor_%g.dat' which contains lines
    <frequency of the mode m> <coupling constants for m>
    couplings should be copied to a separate file
    which is then provided to i-pi input.xml.

       box is highly skewed from orthorhombic, as

       nearest neighbour distance. However, this will not be of
