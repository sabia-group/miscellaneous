I wrote these scripts while working on the cyclohexane project.
They all do similar things - walk through the directories with i-PI PIMD runs
and gather certain statistics: distances/angles between molecules and the surface
or work function values. They are highly ad hoc, rely on a particular atom ordering
in my geometry files, properties of my system etc.
They may give some ideas how to write not-so-bad parsers,
but they cannot be used "as is" in other projects.
